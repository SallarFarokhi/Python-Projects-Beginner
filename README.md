# Python Projects
These are my first uses of Python, which helped me learn the language.

 ## gameoflife.py 
 demonstrates Conway's game of life in a very simple format
 ## hangman.py
 pulls a random word from words_dictionary.json and prompts
 the user to guess the word
 ## sudokerSolver.py
 given a hardcoded sudoku puzzle, iterate through each slot
 until the right combination is found
